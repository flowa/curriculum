## Miksi Clojure?
{: .slide_title .slide}

#### <button class="link" ng-model="block11" ng-click="block11=!block11">Intro</button>

> If you've never programmed before, you may not know that there are
> many languages to choose from. Some of the other languages you might
> have heard of (or will hear of!) are C, JavaScript, Python, and
> Java.
{: ng-show="block11" .description}

> So why are we teaching Clojure? Although it's not as popular as any
> of those languages, we're using Clojure because of three qualities
> it has that make it an ideal first language to learn--or a great
> language to learn in addition to others you might already know:
{: ng-show="block11" .description}

#### Clojure on _yksinkertainen_ <button class="link" ng-bind-html="details" ng-model="block12" ng-click="block12=!block12"></button>

> Clojure is _simple_. That's not to say it's not powerful; it is. The
> number of concepts you have to know to program in Clojure is very
> small, however, and easy to grasp. Clojure grows with you as you
> learn it, and you can be very productive with a small subset of the
> language.
{: ng-show="block12" .description}

#### Clojure on  _yleiskäyttöinen_ <button class="link" ng-bind-html="details" ng-model="block13" ng-click="block13=!block13"></button>

> Clojure is _all-purpose_. Some languages have a specific focus.
> JavaScript, for example, was traditionally used only in web pages
> (although that's changed somewhat). Objective-C is used mainly for
> iPhone apps. We're going to make a drawing application today, but
> you can use Clojure for any sort of application easily.
{: ng-show="block13" .description}

#### Clojure on _hauskaa!_ <button class="link" ng-bind-html="details" ng-model="block14" ng-click="block14=!block14"></button>

> Clojure is _fun_. That's a matter of opinion, of course, but we
> think it holds true. I hope that during this course you experience
> the joy of seeing a Clojure program come together and do something
> powerful and surprising.

## Missä Clojure on hyvä?
{: .slide_title .slide}

#### <button class="link" ng-model="block21" ng-click="block21=!block21">Intro</button>

> So, we said Clojure is all-purpose, and it is. That doesn't mean it

#### Tiedon käsittelyssä <button class="link" ng-bind-html="details" ng-model="block22" ng-click="block22=!block22"></button>

> Clojure is known for being good at data processing. That's because
> it has a good set of data structures--that is, it has several
> built-in ways to represent data that are easy to use and powerful.
{: ng-show="block22" .description}

#### Samainaikaisuudessa <button class="link" ng-bind-html="details" ng-model="block23" ng-click="block23=!block23"></button>

> Clojure is known for its concurrency. Think about writing
> instructions for four of your friends about how to assemble a
> treehouse, but instead of writing them so one step is done at a
> time, each of your friends does part of the job. Then, they
> coordinate at the right time to assemble those parts into bigger
> parts, and they do this over and over again until the end, when it
> all comes together. Those instructions would be really complicated
> and hard to write--and probably hard to read, too. Clojure gives us
> some easy ways to write these sorts of instructions for computers.

#### Kaikessa! <button class="link" ng-bind-html="details" ng-model="block24" ng-click="block24=!block24"></button>

> Clojure also works well for building drawing applications with
> [Quil](https://github.com/quil/quil), which is what we're going to

## Miltä Clojure näyttää?
{: .slide_title .slide}

```clojure
(print-str "Hello, World!")
(+ 3 4)
(forward :trinity 40)
```

#### Sulkeet <button class="link" ng-bind-html="details" ng-model="block31" ng-click="block31=!block31"></button>

> Notice the parentheses. Parentheses enclose instructions to the
> computer in Clojure. A left parenthesis
> is the start of the instruction, and a matching right parenthesis is
> the end of enclosing instruction. Normally, Clojure code has a lot
> of nested parentheses, or in other words, nested enclosing instructions.
{: ng-show="block31" .description}

#### Funktiot <button class="link" ng-bind-html="details" ng-model="block32" ng-click="block32=!block32"></button>

> Next to the parentheses, we see the instructions to the
> computer. That instruction is normally what we call a _function_.
> The functions do all the hard work in Clojure.
> `print-str`, `+` and `forward` are all functions.
> When these functions get run, they return some type of value.
> Clojure functions always return a value.
{: ng-show="block32" .description}

#### Argumentit <button class="link" ng-bind-html="details" ng-model="block33" ng-click="block33=!block33"></button>

> Many functions take in _arguments_--which are everything else inside
> the enclosing parentheses after the function--.
> `print-str` takes "Hello, World!" and returns a string.
> `+` takes 3 and 4, adds them, and returns 7.
> `forward` takes :trinity and 40, moves a turtle by 40 and returns
> the result.

> When we write code, we try to make it as clear as possible. Doing so

{: ng-show="block41" .description}

> In Clojure, comments can be started with a semicolon. Everything
> after a semicolon until the end of that line is a comment that gets

```clojure
;; example functions from a previous slide
(print-str "Hello, World!")  ; a well-known hello world
(+ 3 4)                      ; why not 3 + 4? figure out later

## Mikä on "Read Eval Print Loop"?
{: .slide_title .slide}

#### <button class="link" ng-model="block51" ng-click="block51=!block51">Intro</button>

> "REPL" stands for "Read-Eval-Print-Loop," which still doesn't make a
> ton of sense without context. Many programming languages, including
> Clojure, have a way to execute code interactively so you get instant
> feedback. In other words, the code is read, then it is evaluated,
> then the result is printed, and you begin again--thus, a loop.

## REPL käytännössä
{: .slide_title .slide}


#### Nightcode InstaREPL <button class="link" ng-bind-html="details" ng-model="block61" ng-click="block61=!block61"></button>

> To interact with Clojure, we can use InstaREPL feature of Nightcode.
> It's a nice way to play with Clojure interactively.
{: ng-show="block61" .description}


#### REPL:n käyttö <button class="link" ng-bind-html="details" ng-model="block62" ng-click="block62=!block62"></button>

> Nightcode has a project setting aware REPL on a bottom pane.
>  When "Run with REPL" button gets clicked, this REPL starts.
{: ng-show="block62" .description}

> Alternatively, we can start REPL using leiningen on a terminal (without Nightcode).
> On a terminal, type `lein repl`, then, REPL starts.
> If we hit `lein repl` command within the project directory (folder), it sees the project setting.
{: ng-show="block62" .description}


#### Evaluoi ohjelma tai rivi <button class="link" ng-bind-html="details" ng-model="block63" ng-click="block63=!block63"></button>

<!-- TODO project_name should probably be defined somewhere, right? -->
> Nightcode also lets us evaluate an entire file (program) or line(s).
> On Nightcode, after REPL has started, "Realod File" and "Reload Selection" works.
{: ng-show="block63" .description}
</section>

<section>
#### EXERCISE 1: Try Nightcode InstaREPL

1. Start Nightcode
2. Import `myproject` <br/> (which you created while testing leiningen setup)
3. Open `core.clj` <br/>(`myproject` -> `src` -> `myproject` -> `core.clj`
4. Click __InstREPL__ button
5. Type the Clojure functions below and see what happens

```clojure
(print-str "Hello, World!")
(print-str "Hello, World!" " " "from Clojure")
(+ 3 4)
(- 3 4)
(* 3 4)
```
> Make sure you type the lines <em>exactly</em> as you see them above,
> taking care to put the parentheses in the right locations.
</section>

<section>
#### EXERCISE 2: Evaluate file and line - Part 1

* Open the file `welcometoclojurebridge/src/clojurebridge_turtle/walk.clj`
* Evaluate the entire file by hitting "Run with REPL" followed by "Reload File"
* See what happens
* Type `(forward 40)` on the bottom line of `walk.clj` in the editor. Evaluate this line by selecting line and hitting "Reload Selection"
* See what happens

(Continue on EXERCISE 3)
</section>

<section>
#### EXERCISE 3: Evaluate file and line - Part 2

(Suppose EXERCISE 2 is done)

* Type `(right 90)` and "enter" in the REPL pane (bottom) ![Run with REPL pane](img/run-with-repl.png)
* See what happens to the turtle
* Take a look [Turtles App API](https://github.com/ClojureBridge/welcometoclojurebridge/blob/master/outline/TURTLE.md) and
[How To Walk Turtles](https://github.com/ClojureBridge/welcometoclojurebridge/blob/master/outline/TURTLE-SAMPLES.md)
[section 1 and 2], and try more commands to walk your turtle
</section>

<section>
#### EXERCISE 4: Look at Clojure docs

* In the bottom REPL pane, try to look up the documentation for a function you have used
* You can use the `(doc function-name)` command to do this
* Try `(doc +)` and `(doc forward)` on the REPL
* Try other functions we used so far, for example, `-`, `*`, or `doc`
